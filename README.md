A convenient tool for bulk downloading videos and/or images from user profiles on Civitai.com.

#### Key Features:
* **Download from Multiple Profiles:** Simply list the usernames, one per line.
* **Flexible Content Selection:** Choose to download only videos, only images, or both together using dedicated checkboxes.
* **Advanced Filters:** Sort content by newness, most reactions, and other metrics, and select a time period (Day, Month, Year, etc.).
* **Precise Limit Control:** Set a total maximum number of files to process for each user. Set to `0` for unlimited downloads.
* **Smart Processing:** The app skips already downloaded files but correctly counts them toward the total limit to prevent re-downloading on subsequent runs.
* **Automatic Organization:** Creates a dedicated folder for each user, with `videos` and `images` subfolders inside for easy management.
* **Reliable Connections:** Resilient to network interruptions and will automatically retry downloads.
* **Settings Saver:** All your filters and settings are saved automatically when you close the app.
